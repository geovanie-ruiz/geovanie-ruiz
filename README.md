Hey! My name is GEOVANIE (geo). I write code and now I'm putting it on GitHub for public scrutiny to fight the onset of Dunning-Kruger.

I've wanted to be a software developer for most of my life. It started off as a drive to make video games, and when I finally convinced myself I couldn't draw, I discovered ActionScript. I cut my teeth on AS2 and 3 making games to upload to Newgrounds.

A whole journey later, I'm a professional, self-taught developer with a present focus on Python/Django.

I'm currently working on expanding my repertoire and will be using GitHub as a means to contribute to various open source projects, as well as sharing my progress on my personal projects. In addition to this, I am engaging in the Trailblazer community to extend my skillset into the Saleforce ecosystem.

Aside from application development, I'm also an indie video game developer. I'm using Unity to develop prototypes for the types of games that I would love to be able to produce. I am also a contributor to the RPG Maker community via my Discord server providing Javascript programming help to those in need.

Outside of programming, I am also an avid reader and writer. I hope to one day have the opportunity to bring a story to life in the form of a novel or screenplay. I have always had a fascination with stories and would love to share that joy of adventure I feel when I'm wrapped up in a good story.

That's me in a nutshell. Thanks for reading!
